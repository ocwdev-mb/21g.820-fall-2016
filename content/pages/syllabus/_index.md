Academic Integrity
------------------

Academic integrity is defined by the Center of Academic Integrity as “a commitment, even in the face of adversity to five fundamental values: honesty, trust, fairness, respect, and responsibility.”

Learning a foreign language is not something that typically occurss in isolation. Communication and practice are essential. Therefore, working with others is highly encouraged. However, there are cases in which collaboration is tantamount to cheating. There follow some examples of what is allowed and what is not in our class:

*   Having your pronunciation corrected by a native speaker before an oral presentation is perfectly acceptable. They won’t utter the words for you in class.
*   using a spellchecker is valid if you are writing a text, but having a text edited by another person before submission is clearly a different matter. To a certain extent, the editor is the coauthor of the text.
*   likewise, the use of dictionaries is recommended, but no translation program may be used.
*   obtaining help from people or online resources is allowed as a way of enhancing your learning, but should be avoided altogether if as a result of it, the work submitted is not an accurate representation of the student’s progress or capacity. If that’s the case, it will be considered academic dishonesty.

Cell Phone, Text Messaging and Laptop Policy
--------------------------------------------

**NO CELL PHONES or other electronic communication devices** are to be used during class. No text messaging or e-mailing will be tolerated during class. Cell phones must be turned off or silenced and kept in your backpacks or pockets during class. Laptops may only be used in a case a class activity requires use of the textbook and you have your textbook online and not a physical copy, and **only with the consent of the instructor**.
